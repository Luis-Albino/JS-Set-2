        Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured
        by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads
        into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world's first orbital
        class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most
        expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost
        of space access.
